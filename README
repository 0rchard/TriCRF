Beta release 
Jan 10, 2010
(This software was written in 2007~2008.)

The following papers use this code:
Minwoo Jeong and Gary Geunbae Lee. Triangular-chain Conditional Random Fields. IEE TASLP, 2008.
http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2008.925143

==================
1. INSTALLATION
You can simply type "make" on console.
This code requires "gcc version 3.x and later."
(It was tested on linux, Mac OSX, and Windows.)

==================
2. DATA FORMAT
The examples in data file should be separated with blank line.
In addition, the first column indicates the class label.
For TriCRF, the first row in each examples means `topic' assignment and its features. For example, in SLU decribed in (Jeong and Lee, 2008), `topic' is a dialogue act (i.e., the semantic meaning of a sentence).
Other lines are used for sequential labeling task.
For clarity, please see the example data file in sub-folder, example.
Please be sure that your data file is written in unix form.

=================
3. RUN
This code is able to run with configuration file.
Briefly, the config file describes the model type, estimation method, data file name, and hyperparameters that include the number of iteration, prior value, and so on.
Usage: ./max configuration_file_name
